This repository contains a Dockerfile with a common error and its solution. The error occurs when the Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies using pip3 install -r requirements.txt, but the requirements.txt file is missing or located in the wrong directory.  This leads to a build failure. The solution demonstrates the correct way to structure the Dockerfile and ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.
